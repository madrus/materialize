# About this documentation

Here I am collecting some important tips and tricks. I am doing it "along the way", every time I get stuck and need a good advice for the next time. Therefore, the documentation is never complete and finished. It is always work in progress.

Here are some important links I used as initial input:

* Latest official [MkDocs documentation](http://mkdocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* [MkDocs User Guide](http://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/writing-your-docs/)
* [Material Design Theme for MkDocs](http://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)
